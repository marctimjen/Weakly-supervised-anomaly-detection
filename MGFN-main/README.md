## This the official repo of paper accepted in AAAI 2023 Oral
### Pretrained models and ground truth documents can be downloaded in here:[Onedrive](https://connecthkuhk-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/cyxcarol_connect_hku_hk/EgbkWG-7TbFOnm28TLcyFaABHnniV6rcp_gzGm6OOVDWOQ?e=LrBlD5)
#### Prepare the environment: 
        $pip install -r requirement.txt
#### Test: Download the pretrained model and run $test.py
#### Dataset Prepare: [UCF-crime ten-crop I3D](https://connecthkuhk-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/cyxcarol_connect_hku_hk/EpNI-JSruH1Ep1su07pVLgIBnjDcBGd7Mexb1ERUVShdNg?e=VMRjhE). Rename the data path in ucf-i3d.list and ucf-i3d-test.list based on your data path.
#### Train: Modify the option.py and run main.py
