# Weakly supervised anomaly detection

> This is the github repo for the project "Weakly supervised anomaly detection" by: Anastasia Drozdova, Andreas JÃ¸rgensen & Marc Jensen.

Note that this repo contain some __init__.py files to make some directories into py packages. These files will be ignored since they do not contain any informaiton.

Note that there in some of the scripts will be a doc-string telling more about what the goal of the specific scripts is.


How to get started:
1. Download or generate video features. In this repo features has been downloaded from the sites:
[xd-violence](https://roc-ng.github.io/XD-Violence/) and [UCF-crime ten-crop I3D](https://connecthkuhk-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/cyxcarol_connect_hku_hk/EpNI-JSruH1Ep1su07pVLgIBnjDcBGd7Mexb1ERUVShdNg?e=VMRjhE).
Note that the xd-violence features comes crop-wise (of five crops). This means that one video exists as five .npy feature-files.
The networks implemented in this repo use a concatenated version of the feature files. To concatenate the XD files this script has been used: [crop_to_file.py](data%2Fxd_crop_to_file%2Fcrop_to_file.py).

2. The next step is to obtain the lists with paths to the individual files. These lists are known as "rgb_lists". For the XD-violence data-set the list has been generated
with this file: [make_lists_xd.py](data%2Fmake_lists%2Fmake_lists_xd.py).

3. (Optinal) To generate a validation data-set with associated rgb_lists (one for the validation set and one for the train set) use the dir: [create_val_split](data%2Fcreate_val_split).

4. Generate or download the gt-file (ground truth) for the test set. In this repo both the UCF and XD gt has been generated. Here the dir is used: [create_gt](data%2Fcreate_gt).
To use the functions in the dir, one needs the annotation files from the official data-provideres (they are available from the links to the data-sets in 1.).

5. Now the data should be setup for training and testing of the models. In the model-dirs different train-files should exist (see the contents-lists below). For instance to train
a MGFN model on the UCF-data (with a validation on the validation set) run the [MGFN_main_ucf.py](MGFNmain%2FMGFN_main_ucf.py). To run a model with validation on the test-set use the
files containing _cheat. For instance one can run: [MGFN_cheat_ucf.py](MGFNmain%2FMGFN_cheat_ucf.py) to train the MGFN model on the UCF-data with validation on the UCF-test set.

6. To test the models one can use the subdirectories: "xd_test" and "ucf_test". These calculate the loss on the train- and test-sets, result metrics and create plots of the predictions (and AUC + PR curves).

The structure of the code is as follows:

How to upload result data for the models to neptune? -> Use either the xd_test og ucf_test for the MGFN or RTFM model.

Firstly we run the [1_RTFM_xd_upload.py](RTFMmain%2Fxd_test%2F1_RTFM_xd_upload.py) file to get a neptune run + the loss of the model at the current iteration. Remember to set the path to the correct model and set the parameters for this model correctly.
Then we run the [2_RTFM_xd_test.py](RTFMmain%2Fxd_test%2F2_RTFM_xd_test.py) file to get the results of the model. These results are also uploaded to neptune (remember to set the -n for neptune run argument).
Lastly we can upload the plots using the test-file create before and the script: [3_RTFM_xd_test_plotter.py](RTFMmain%2Fxd_test%2F3_RTFM_xd_test_plotter.py). 
If multiple loss calculations has been done, then an average can be taken and uploaded to Neptune with: [4_RTFM_xd_losswidth.py](RTFMmain%2Fxd_test%2F4_RTFM_xd_losswidth.py).
