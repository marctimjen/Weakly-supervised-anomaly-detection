# Weakly supervised anomaly detection
 This is the github repo for the project "Weakly supervised anomaly detection" by: Drozdova Anastasia, Jensen Marc & JÃ¸rgensen Andreas.

Note that this repo contain some __init__.py files to make some directories into py packages. These files will be ignored since they do not contain any informaiton.

Note that there in some of the scripts will be a doc-string telling more about what the goal of the specific scripts is.

The structure of the code is as follows:

[data](data): This dir is used to preprocess the data in different ways.
- [create_gt](data%2Fcreate_gt): This dir is specifically used to generate the ground truth files (gt) files.
  - [create_gt_xd.py](data%2Fcreate_gt%2Fcreate_gt_xd.py): Create the gt file for the xd-violence dataset.
  - [create_test_gt.py](data%2Fcreate_gt%2Fcreate_test_gt.py): This file creates the gt file for the UCF-crime dataset.
  - [create_UCF_masks.py](data%2Fcreate_gt%2Fcreate_UCF_masks.py): This script is used to generate masks for the different classes for the gt file.
- [create_val_split](data%2Fcreate_val_split): This dir is used to create a validation dataset for the UCF-data.
  - [create_val_split_UCF.py](data%2Fcreate_val_split%2Fcreate_val_split_UCF.py): Creates the val/train split of the training data.
  - [MGFN_test_gt.py](data%2Fcreate_val_split%2FMGFN_test_gt.py): This script is used to test the gt-file of the UCF-dataset.
  - [move_files_UCF.py](data%2Fcreate_val_split%2Fmove_files_UCF.py): This .py file is used to move the validation features from the train-dir to a validation-dir.
- [make_lists](data%2Fmake_lists): This dir is used to make lists that point to the different train/test files.
  - [make_lists_xd.py](data%2Fmake_lists%2Fmake_lists_xd.py): This script produce the RGB lists for the xd-violence dataset.
- [xd_crop_to_file](data%2Fxd_crop_to_file): The features downloaded from the page: [xd-violence](https://roc-ng.github.io/XD-Violence/) came crop-wise and not as a whole feature.
  - [crop_to_file.py](data%2Fxd_crop_to_file%2Fcrop_to_file.py): This file turns the individually crops into a total feature.

[download_features](download_features): This dir is used to obtain the MGFN-features from the link: [UCF-crime ten-crop I3D](https://connecthkuhk-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/cyxcarol_connect_hku_hk/EpNI-JSruH1Ep1su07pVLgIBnjDcBGd7Mexb1ERUVShdNg?e=VMRjhE)
- [auto_download.py](download_features%2Fauto_download.py): This file is used to download the features one at a time.

[MGFNmain](MGFNmain): This dir is used to implement the MGFN model.
- [cheat](MGFNmain%2Fcheat): This dir contain files for calculating the test-results of the train-epochs of the model.
  - [cheat_test.py](MGFNmain%2Fcheat%2Fcheat_test.py): Is used to test/validate the MGFN model on the UCF train set.
  - [cheat_test_xd.py](MGFNmain%2Fcheat%2Fcheat_test_xd.py): Is used to test/validate the MGFN model on the XD train set.
- [datasets](MGFNmain%2Fdatasets) Contain the datasets used in the training/testing of the MGFN model.
  - [dataset.py](MGFNmain%2Fdatasets%2Fdataset.py): This is the specific data-set used. It can load both UCF and XD data.
- [models](MGFNmain%2Fmodels): Contain the implementation of the MGFN model.
  - [mgfn.py](MGFNmain%2Fmodels%2Fmgfn.py): The specific file that contain the code for the MGFN model.
- [utils](MGFNmain%2Futils): Contain some utility functions used in the MGFN network. 

- [MGFN_cheat.py](MGFNmain%2FMGFN_cheat.py): Is the training of the MGFN model on the UCF data using the testing on each epoch.
- [MGFN_cheat_xd.py](MGFNmain%2FMGFN_cheat_xd.py): Is the training of the MGFN model on the XD data using the testing on each epoch.

- [params.py](MGFNmain%2Fparams.py): This file is used to set the hyper-parameteres of the model.
- [train.py](MGFNmain%2Ftrain.py): This file contain the loss functions, train and validation functions for the training for the network.
