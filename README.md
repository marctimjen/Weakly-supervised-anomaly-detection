# Weakly supervised anomaly detection

> This is the github repo for the project "Weakly supervised anomaly detection" by: Drozdova Anastasia, Jensen Marc & JÃ¸rgensen Andreas.

Note that this repo contain some __init__.py files to make some directories into py packages. These files will be ignored since they do not contain any informaiton.

Note that there in some of the scripts will be a doc-string telling more about what the goal of the specific scripts is.


How to get started: 
1. Download or generate video features. In this repo features has been downloaded from the sites:
[xd-violence](https://roc-ng.github.io/XD-Violence/) and [UCF-crime ten-crop I3D](https://connecthkuhk-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/cyxcarol_connect_hku_hk/EpNI-JSruH1Ep1su07pVLgIBnjDcBGd7Mexb1ERUVShdNg?e=VMRjhE).
Note that the xd-violence features comes crop-wise (of five crops). This means that one video exists as five .npy feature-files when downloaded. 
The networks implemented in this repo use a concatenated version of the feature files. To concatenate the files this script has been used: [crop_to_file.py](data%2Fxd_crop_to_file%2Fcrop_to_file.py).

2. The next step is to obtain the lists with paths to the individual files.

3. Generate or download the GT-file (ground truth) for the test set.

4. Train the models.

5. Test the models and upload data to Neptune.

The structure of the code is as follows:

How to upload data for the MGFN model to neptune?

Firstly we run the [MGFN_UCF_upload.py](MGFNmain%2FUCF_pretrained_test%2FMGFN_UCF_upload.py) file to get a neptuen run + the loss of the model at the current iteration. Remember to set the path to the correct model and set the parameters for this model correctly.
Then we run the [MGFN_UCF_test.py](MGFNmain%2FUCF_pretrained_test%2FMGFN_UCF_test.py) file to get the results of the model. These results are also uploaded to neptune (remember to set the -n for neptune run argument).
Lastly we can upload the plots using the test-file create before and the script: [MGFN_test_plotter.py](MGFNmain%2FUCF_pretrained_test%2FMGFN_test_plotter.py).
